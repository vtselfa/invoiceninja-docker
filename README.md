# Docker for [Invoice Ninja](https://www.invoiceninja.com/) 

:bulb: Please consider posting your question on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) as this widens the audience that can help you. Just use the tag `invoice-ninja` and we are there to help. This is mostly related to the usage of Invoice Ninja and the docker setup.
If you feel your question is directly related to a code change or you want to sent in a change + PR Github is the right place, of course.

:crown: **Features**

:lock: Automatic HTTPS (:heart: [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/))  
:hammer: Fully production-ready through docker-compose  
:pencil: Adjustable to your needs via environment variable  


## Prerequisites

### Generate an application key

Before starting Invoice Ninja via Docker make sure you generate a valid application key. If you are not sure what an application key is, please visit [this blog post](https://tighten.co/blog/app-key-and-you/).  

To generate an application just run

```shell
docker run --rm -it invoiceninja/invoiceninja php artisan key:generate --show
```

This will generate an application key for you which you need later.

### Create folders for data persistence

To make your data persistent, you have to mount `public` and `storage` from your host to your containers.

1. Create two folder on your host, e. g. `/var/invoiceninja/public` and `/var/invoiceninja/storage`
2. Mount these folders into your container - see [usage](#usage)

You can create these folders wherever you want on your host system.

:warning: When using host mounted folder for persistence, make sure they are owned by the proper user and group. As we run Invoice Ninja without `root` , we use a separate user, the folders on the host system need to be owned by uid `1000` and a gid `1001`.  

Run this on your host system

```shell
chown -R 1000:1001 /var/invoiceninja/public /var/invoiceninja/storage
```

to apply the proper permission to the folders. This also applies to the `docker-compose` setup when using [bind-mounted host directories](https://github.com/invoiceninja/dockerfiles/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L17).


### PhantomJS key

The PhantomJS key is set to `a-demo-key-with-low-quota-per-ip-address`. This demo key is limited to 100 requests per day.

To set a different key feel free to add `-e PHANTOMJS_CLOUD_KEY='<INSERT YOUR PHANTOMJS KEY HERE>'` to thee docker command below.

For further configuration and toubleshotting regarding PhantomJS and Invoice Ninja [see documentation here](https://docs.invoiceninja.com/configure.html?#phantomjs).


## Usage

To run it:

```shell
docker run -d \
  -v /var/invoiceninja/public:/var/app/public \
  -v /var/invoiceninja/storage:/var/app/storage \
  -e APP_URL='http://ninja.dev' \
  -e APP_KEY='<INSERT THE GENERATED APPLICATION KEY HERE>' \
  -e DB_HOST='localhost' \
  -e DB_DATABASE='ninja' \
  -e DB_USERNAME='ninja' \
  -e DB_PASSWORD='ninja' \
  -p '9000:9000' \
  invoiceninja/invoiceninja
```
A list of environment variables can be found [here](https://github.com/invoiceninja/invoiceninja/blob/master/.env.example).


### With docker-compose

Running Invoice Ninja with docker-compose gives you everything to quickly start. Before starting please make sure you configured your setup correctly. You can do so by opening the `docker-compose.yml` and may change the follwing items.

**Port**

_default: 80_  

This is the port where your Invoice Ninja is reachable, when you type in `http://<your-domain.com>`. If it should be different than `80` make sure to call your installation `http://<your-domain.com>:<YOUR-PORT>`, e. g. `http://<your-domain.com>:8080`.

```yml
ports: 
  - "8080:80" # To run it on port 8080
```

:warning: Make sure the port set is available and not occupied by another service on your host system.

**URL and application key**

_default: https://localhost_

For generating a proper application key see [generate an application key](#generate-an-application-key). Change the value where your Invoice Ninja installation should be reachable.

```yml
environment: 
  - APP_URL=http://localhost
````

**MYSQL root password**

_default: ninjaAdm1nPassword_

The mysql database server comes with two users: one for accessing the Invoice Ninja database and the `root` user. Please change the default password for `root` to something more special :wink:

**Volumes and directories**

_default: volumes_

This is the place where your uploaded files are stored. Normally this is a so called _volume_ which can be reused by different docker containers. One might prefer to store the files directly on the host system - for this the config section is prepared with what is called _bind-mounted host directory_. Just adjust the paths and Invoice Ninja stores the user files on the host system.

```yml
volumes:
  ...
  # Configure your mounted directories, make sure the folder 'public' and 'storage'
  # exist, before mounting them
  #-  public:/var/www/app/public
  #-  storage:/var/www/app/storage
  # you may use a bind-mounted host directory instead, so that it is harder to accidentally remove the volume and lose all your data!
  - ./docker/app/public:/var/www/app/public:rw,delegated
  - ./docker/app/storage:/var/www/app/storage:rw,delegated
```

The sample above stores the files on the post at `./docker/app/public` and `./docker/app/storage`.

:warning: If using bind-mounted host directories make sure they exists and have proper rights. See [here](#create-folders-for-data-persistence) for details.


## Debugging your Docker setup

Even when running your Invoice Ninja setup with Docker - errors can occur. Depending on where the error happens - the webserver, Invoice Ninja or the database - different log files can be responsible. 

### Show logs without `docker-compose`

If you are not running `docker-compose` you first need to find the container id for your php container with `docker ps`. Then you can run

```shell
docker logs -f <CONTAINER NAME>
```

This gives you a constant output of the log files for the php container.

### Show logs with `docker-compose`

If you are running the `docker-compose` setup you can output all logs, from all containers, with the following command

```shell
docker-compose logs -f
```

If you better want a physical log file in in your `storage/logs` folder, just add `-e LOG=single` to the [usage](#usage) command. 
Or add an environment variable 

```yml
...
environment:
  LOG: single
...
```

to your `docker-compose.yml`.

This generated log file will only hold Invoice Ninja information.
